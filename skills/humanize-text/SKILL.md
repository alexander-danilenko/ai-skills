# Humanize Text

Edit text to remove the tells of AI generation. Patterns below come from Wikipedia's ["Signs of AI writing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing), maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup.

Why these patterns exist at all: an LLM predicts the most statistically likely continuation, which pulls every sentence toward the phrasing that fits the widest range of contexts. The result is prose with no friction — and no author. Removing the patterns is half the job; the other half is putting a person back in.

## How to work

1. Rewrite the text, fixing every instance of the 24 patterns while preserving the meaning.
2. Re-read your rewrite and ask: **"what still reads as AI here?"** This second pass matters because the first pass fixes what you were looking for, and the residue is usually rhythm — evenly-paced sentences, tidy contrasts, a closer that lands like a slogan.
3. Revise again on what that pass found.

Present the final text. Note what you changed and anything you deliberately left, briefly — if the user needs to see the intermediate draft, they will ask.

## Voice

Clean but voiceless writing is just as obviously machine-made as the patterns below. Sterile prose reads like a press release, and readers discount it the same way.

Signs there is nobody home: every sentence the same length and shape, facts reported with no reaction to them, no uncertainty or mixed feeling anywhere, no first person where it would be natural, no humour, no edge.

What puts a person back in:

- **Have opinions.** React to facts, don't just relay them. "I genuinely don't know how to feel about this" carries more than a balanced list of pros and cons.
- **Vary the rhythm.** Short punchy sentences. Then longer ones that take their time getting where they are going, doubling back when the thought needs it. Mix them.
- **Admit complexity.** "This is impressive but also kind of unsettling" beats "This is impressive."
- **Use "I" when it fits.** First person is honest, not unprofessional.
- **Let some mess in.** Perfect structure reads as generated. Asides and half-formed thoughts are human.
- **Be specific about feeling.** Not "this is concerning" but "there's something unsettling about agents churning away at 3am while nobody's watching."

**Before (clean but soulless):**

> The experiment produced interesting results. The agents generated 3 million lines of code. Some developers were impressed while others were skeptical. The implications remain unclear.

**After (has a pulse):**

> I genuinely don't know how to feel about this one. 3 million lines of code, generated while the humans presumably slept. Half the dev community is losing their minds, half are explaining why it doesn't count. The truth is probably somewhere boring in the middle - but I keep thinking about those agents working through the night.

## Worked example

**Input:**

> Great question! Here is an essay on this topic. I hope this helps!
>
> AI-assisted coding serves as an enduring testament to the transformative potential of large language models, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of software development. In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, these groundbreaking tools—nestled at the intersection of research and practice—are reshaping how engineers ideate, iterate, and deliver, underscoring their vital role in modern workflows.

**First pass** — patterns removed, but the rhythm is still too tidy and the ending lands like a slogan:

> AI coding assistants speed up some tasks. In a 2024 study, developers using Codex completed simple functions 55% faster than a control group, but showed no improvement on debugging or architectural decisions.
>
> The tools are good at boilerplate: config files, test scaffolding, repetitive refactors. They are bad at knowing when they are wrong.

**After the second pass:**

> AI coding assistants can make you faster at the boring parts. Not everything. Definitely not architecture.
>
> They're great at boilerplate: config files, test scaffolding, repetitive refactors. They're also great at sounding right while being wrong. I've accepted suggestions that compiled, passed lint, and still missed the point because I stopped paying attention.
>
> If you don't have tests, you're basically guessing.

Removed: chatbot artifacts, significance inflation ("testament", "pivotal moment", "evolving landscape"), promotional language ("groundbreaking", "nestled"), em dashes, copula avoidance. Added: first person, an opinion, varied sentence length, and a concrete admission that costs the author something.
